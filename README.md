# Temp-Measure-Control-PT100
Temperature is one of the main parameters to be controlled in most of the manufacturing industries like chemical, food processing, pharmaceutical etc. In these industries some product needs the required temperature to be maintained at highest priority or else the product will fail. So, the temperature controller is most widely used in almost all the industries. In this project we are going to design a circuit for measuring temperature. This circuit is developed using “PT100”. Temperature is usually measured in “Centigrade” and “Fahrenheit”. The goal of this project is to design an ambient temperature measurement and control circuit. The actual temperature is sensed by the temperature sensor. It is displayed on LCD in both units of temperature, and then some additional functions are carried out automatically depending upon that temperature. Like turning heater on if temp falls below a certain point and turning fan on if it exceeds a certain limit. Or else keeping both of them off if the temp is in the range of normal temperature. There range values of turning these on are also adjustable by the user as per their need
